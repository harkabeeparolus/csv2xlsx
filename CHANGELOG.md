## unreleased

- Nothing yet

## 0.4.0 - 2020-07-28

  not available on PyPI.

## 0.3.1 - 2020-07-27

### Changed

- Single-source package version number from _pyproject.toml_, instead of
  manually duplicating it in several different places.

## 0.3.0 - 2020-07-27

### Added

- Handle multiple input files from the command line, instead of just one.

Initial Github release â€” <https://github.com/harkabeeparolus/csv2xlsx>

### Added

- Proper Poetry project structure
- Wrote documentation; added the [README](README.md)
  and [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) files.

### Changed

- Changed the `--no-numbers` option to `--numbers`, since I almost never
  want to auto-convert numerical values.
